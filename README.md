# BullsAndCows
C# Console Application where one player guesses a randomly generated secret code. 

The Objective: One player tries to guess a secret number in as few tries as possible.

How To Play: Start the program and 
enter the number of digits you want to guess according to the prompt. 
Enter if you need to cheat or not (this is typically for testing only). 
The program will ask you, digit by digit, for each positional guess. 
If a number you enter is anywhere in the secret code, your cow count 
goes up by one. If a number you entered is in the exact same position 
as a number in the secret code, your bull count goes up by one.

Saving: If you want to save your scores, create a folder named data on your C drive.
The directory should look as follows: C:\\data. When you play, the program will do the rest.
